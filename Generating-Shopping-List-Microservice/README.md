# Shopping-List-Generator
This microservice retrieves the user's stock from Microservice 1 and the saved recipes from Microservice 2, generating a JSON-formatted list of missing items based on this information. It then sends this list to [Spoonacular API-Compute Shopping List](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Compute-Shopping-List) to generate a comprehensive shopping list that includes each item's aisle, name, measures, and cost.
